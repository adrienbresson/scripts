Hi All

I found the solution for 2. ( Videos pauses every few seconds: ), the screen flicker making me very nervous thing .... ( black screen then video comes back and black screen again )

It seems like that the raspb is trying to sync the depth of the resolution from your TV, i.e on bootup the raspb is switching the TV via HDMI to 1080p60 -> but ! changing this in xbmc does not effect to your TV, so someone is trying (kernel driver or hardware) to correct this everytime.

I but my TV in 1080p24 mode, this is how i have done it

First, stop xbmc

Code:
pi@raspbmc:~$ sudo initctl stop xbmc

go and get fbset

Code:
pi@raspbmc:~$ sudo apt-get install fbset

take a look to the current framebuffer settings

Code:
pi@raspbmc:~$ fbset

mode "1920x1080"
    geometry 1920 1080 1920 1080 16
    timings 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    rgba 5/11,6/5,5/0,0/16
endmode

enable hardware acceleration, maybe to improve the xbmc GUI rendering and to enjoy some 3DDemos quite faster, dunno if the accel is needed but why not giving a try to learn something

Code:
fbset -accel true

now take a look again

Code:
pi@raspbmc:~$ fbset

mode "1920x1080"
    geometry 1920 1080 1920 1080 16
    timings 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    accel true
    rgba 5/11,6/5,5/0,0/16
endmode

ok, let's get git and build-essential

Code:
pi@raspbmc:~$ sudo apt-get install git build-essential

clone the raspb firmware, this takes a lot of space ! ~600mb

Code:
pi@raspbmc:~$ git clone git://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware.git

now lets move some files where they should be

Code:
pi@raspbmc:~$ cd firmware/opt/vc
pi@raspbmc:~/firmware/opt/vc$ sudo mv bin /opt/vc/
pi@raspbmc:~/firmware/opt/vc$ sudo mv include /opt/vc/
pi@raspbmc:~/firmware/opt/vc$ sudo mv sbin /opt/vc/
pi@raspbmc:~/firmware/opt/vc$ sudo mv src /opt/vc/

tell our TV to switch to 1080p24 but first have a look to the supported resolutions of your TV

Code:
pi@raspbmc:~/firmware/opt/vc$ cd /opt/vc/bin
pi@raspbmc:/opt/vc/bin$ ./tvservice --modes=CEA
Group CEA has 15 modes:
           mode 1: 640x480 @ 60Hz, progressive
           mode 2: 720x480 @ 60Hz, progressive
           mode 3: 720x480 @ 60Hz, progressive
           mode 4: 1280x720 @ 60Hz, progressive
           mode 5: 1920x1080 @ 60Hz, interlaced
  (native) mode 16: 1920x1080 @ 60Hz, progressive
           mode 17: 720x576 @ 50Hz, progressive
           mode 18: 720x576 @ 50Hz, progressive
           mode 19: 1280x720 @ 50Hz, progressive
           mode 20: 1920x1080 @ 50Hz, interlaced
           mode 21: 720x576 @ 50Hz, interlaced
  (native) mode 31: 1920x1080 @ 50Hz, progressive
           mode 32: 1920x1080 @ 24Hz, progressive
           mode 33: 1920x1080 @ 25Hz, progressive
           mode 34: 1920x1080 @ 30Hz, progressive
pi@raspbmc:/opt/vc/bin$

ok mode 32 is the one for me what i was looking for

Code:
pi@raspbmc:/opt/vc/bin$ ./tvservice --explicit="CEA 32"
Powering on HDMI with explicit settings (CEA mode 32)
pi@raspbmc:/opt/vc/bin$

let's check

Code:
pi@raspbmc:/opt/vc/bin$ ./tvservice -s
state: HPD high|HDMI mode|HDCP off|composite off (0x12001a), 1920x1080 @ 24Hz, progressive
pi@raspbmc:/opt/vc/bin$

yeah done, start xbmc

Code:
pi@raspbmc:/opt/vc/bin$ sudo initctl start xbmc
